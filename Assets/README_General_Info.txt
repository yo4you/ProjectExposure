Hello there!

Some rules for you:

0) Please, make sure to read README files in important foldes (Models, Scenes, Prefabs, etc)

1) Put everything in proper folders!

Because if you put smth smwhere else, it will NOT be synced with other team members. 
It means you can keep some kinda garbage(memes) in root directory and etc, but its not professional.
 
(i.e if Max needs to create a scene for himself, 
he should put it in his own folder - Scenes/Max/)

...More on scenes in the README_Scenes.txt in Scenes/

2) Name everything properly!

The general convention for our project is: "Whatisit_Keyword_NAME.somekindaextension"

For example, "Model_CharacterType2_PAVOL.fbx", "Prefab_MainMenuButtons_WEI-JING.prefab" and etc.

Anyways, important folders have their own README files.

3) Just follow the rules above before you add anything and everything will be fine (maybe)
